# Fore ideas

1) Include an alternate table view for viewing #pars, # tweeters, # bogies, dbls, eagles etc.
2) Create a function or class to calculate Fanduel points based on all of the above ^
3) Display current Fanduel points in the table
4) Feed a list of comma separated golfers into the cmd 'fore -G Jon Rahm, Lanto Griffin, Tommy Fleetwood, Tony Finau'
5) Move to Class based structure 
6) Sync golfers.txt to server with "accounts" for each of us to differentiate our .txts
